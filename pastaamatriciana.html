          <h2>Pasta all' Amatriciana</h2>
          <p>Servings: 4 / Estimated Time: 30 mins</p>
          <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>3 ounces thinly sliced pancetta, finely chopped</li>
            <li>10 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>14 1/2-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, drained, juices reserved, tomatoes crushed by hand into small pieces</li>
            <li>1-ounce chunk pecorino Romano cheese, plus more finely grated, to serve</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Directions: </h2>
          <ol>
            <li>In a 12-inch skillet over medium, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring, until well-browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Return the skillet to medium and add the garlic; cook, stirring, until light golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the wine, increase to medium-high and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the draioned tomatoes and cook, stirring, until heated, about 2 minutes. Stir in 3 tablespoons of the reserved tomato juice, then remove from heat.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 2 quarts of water and pecorino chunk to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent the cheese from sticking to the pot. Stir in the pasta and 2 teaspoons salt. Cook, stirring often, until the pasta is just shy of al dente. Remove and discard the pecorino, then drain the pasta in a colander set in a large heat-safe bowl; reserve the cooking water.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Set the skillet over medium-high, stir in 1 1/2 cups of the reserved pasta water and bring to a simmer. Add the drained pasta, tossing with tongs. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has been absorbed, 3 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Off heat, stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the pancetta and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve with grated pecorino on the side.</li>
            <br>
          </ol>
